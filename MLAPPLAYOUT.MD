# ML APP Layout
 While there are many possible ways to use machine learning (ML) within a Flogo app, there exists a fairly standard way to create an ML app within Flogo.  Here we are going to discuss the basic layout of such an app with a few typical variants based upon triggers / usecases.

### General structure

#### Streams

#### Flows

### GUI

Currently, the inference activity is not included in the GUI because it would require the TensorFlow dynamic libs to be installed, which would bloat the GUI docker image.

### Rough CLI pipeline

### Go app with Flogo library pipeline
